# Revelio

I founded [Revelio](https://getrevelio.com) with the intention of providing powerful tools to help developers solve problems I've run into myself.
As I look back, most of the project ideas I've had throughout my career have had developers as the target audience.

## Revelio API Documentation

An [API documentation tool](https://getrevelio.com) aimed at reducing the manual effort needed for keeping Web API documentation up to date.
It initially started as a tool for .NET Web API sites, but has expanded to support [Open API](http://openapis.org) and [apiDoc](apidocjs.com) specifications.
It supports any number of teams and projects.

## Revelio Pumlhorse

[Highly-readable scripting tool](http://pumlhorse.com) for quickly generating integration tests, DevOps scripts, or just JavaScript scratchpads. 
Out-of-the-box HTTP request support, with support for custom modules.

## markdown-shortcuts

A [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) extension for editing Markdown files. Provides keyboard shortcuts, like adding or removing bold/italic text, similar to
what you'd expect with an editor like Microsoft Word. [More info](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)
